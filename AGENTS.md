# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

INTERCEPT is a web-based Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) platform providing a unified Flask interface for software-defined radio (SDR) tools. It supports pager decoding, 433MHz sensors, ADS-B aircraft tracking, ACARS messaging, WiFi/Bluetooth scanning, satellite tracking, ISS SSTV decoding, AIS vessel tracking, weather satellite imagery (NOAA APT & Meteor LRPT), and Meshtastic mesh networking.

## Common Commands

### Docker (Primary)
```bash
# Build and run (basic profile)
docker compose --profile basic up -d

# Build and run with ADS-B history (Postgres)
docker compose --profile history up -d

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose --profile basic up -d --build

# Multi-arch build (amd64 + arm64 for RPi)
./build-multiarch.sh
```

### Local Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# First-time setup (interactive wizard with install profiles)
./setup.sh

# Or headless full install
./setup.sh --non-interactive

# Or install specific profiles
./setup.sh --profile=core,weather

# Run with production server (gunicorn + gevent, handles concurrent SSE/WebSocket)
sudo ./start.sh

# Or for quick local dev (Flask dev server)
sudo -E venv/bin/python intercept.py

# Other setup utilities
./setup.sh --health-check      # Verify installation
./setup.sh --postgres-setup    # Set up ADS-B history database
./setup.sh --menu              # Force interactive menu
```

### Testing

```

## Architecture

### Entry Points
- `setup.sh` - Menu-driven installer with profile system (wizard, health check, PostgreSQL setup, env configurator, update, uninstall). Sources `.env` on startup via `start.sh`.
- `start.sh` - Production startup script (gunicorn + gevent auto-detection, CLI flags, HTTPS, `.env` sourcing, fallback to Flask dev server)
- `intercept.py` - Direct Flask dev server entry point (quick local development)
- `app.py` - Flask application initialization, global state management, process lifecycle, SSE streaming infrastructure, conditional gevent monkey-patch

### Route Blueprints (routes/)
Each signal type has its own Flask blueprint:
- `pager.py` - POCSAG/FLEX decoding via rtl_fm + multimon-ng
- `sensor.py` - 433MHz IoT sensors via rtl_433
- `adsb.py` - Aircraft tracking via dump1090 (SBS protocol on port 30003)
- `acars.py` - Aircraft datalink messages via acarsdec
- `wifi.py`, `wifi_v2.py` - WiFi scanning (legacy and unified APIs)
- `bluetooth.py`, `bluetooth_v2.py` - Bluetooth scanning (legacy and unified APIs)
- `satellite.py` - Pass prediction using TLE data
- `sstv.py` - ISS SSTV image decoding via slowrx
- `weather_sat.py` - NOAA APT & Meteor LRPT via SatDump
- `ais.py` - AIS vessel tracking and VHF DSC distress monitoring
- `aprs.py` - Amateur packet radio via direwolf
- `rtlamr.py` - Utility meter reading
- `meshtastic_routes.py` - Meshtastic LoRa mesh networking

### Core Utilities (utils/)

**SDR Abstraction Layer** (`utils/sdr/`):
- `SDRFactory` with factory pattern for multiple SDR types (RTL-SDR, LimeSDR, HackRF, Airspy, SDRPlay)
- Each type has a `CommandBuilder` for generating CLI commands

**Bluetooth Module** (`utils/bluetooth/`):
- Multi-backend: DBus/BlueZ primary, fallback for systems without BlueZ
- `aggregator.py` - Merges observations across time
- `tracker_signatures.py` - 47K+ known tracker fingerprints (AirTag, Tile, SmartTag)
- `heuristics.py` - Behavioral analysis for device classification

**TSCM (Counter-Surveillance)** (`utils/tscm/`):
- `baseline.py` - Snapshot "normal" RF environment
- `detector.py` - Compare current scan to baseline, flag anomalies
- `device_identity.py` - Track devices despite MAC randomization
- `correlation.py` - Cross-reference Bluetooth and WiFi observations

**WiFi Utilities** (`utils/wifi/`):
- Platform-agnostic scanner with parsers for airodump-ng, nmcli, iw, iwlist, airport (macOS)
- `channel_analyzer.py` - Frequency band analysis

**Weather Satellite** (`utils/weather_sat.py`):
- Singleton `WeatherSatDecoder` using SatDump CLI for NOAA APT and Meteor LRPT
- Subprocess management with stdout parsing, image watcher via rglob
- Pass prediction using skyfield TLE data

**SSTV Decoder** (`utils/sstv.py`):
- ISS SSTV reception via slowrx with Doppler tracking
- Singleton pattern, image gallery with timestamped filenames

### Key Patterns

**Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: All real-time features stream via SSE endpoints (`/stream_pager`, `/stream_sensor`, etc.). Pattern uses `queue.Queue` with timeout and keepalive messages. Under gunicorn + gevent, each SSE connection is a lightweight greenlet instead of an OS thread.

**Process Management**: External decoders run as subprocesses with output threads feeding queues. Use `safe_terminate()` for cleanup. Global locks prevent race conditions.

**Data Stores**: `DataStore` class with TTL-based automatic cleanup (WiFi: 10min, Bluetooth: 5min, Aircraft: 5min).

**Input Validation**: Centralized in `utils/validation.py` - always validate frequencies, gains, device indices before spawning processes.

### External Tool Integrations

| Tool | Purpose | Integration |
|------|---------|-------------|
| rtl_fm | FM demodulation | Subprocess, pipes to multimon-ng |
| multimon-ng | Pager decoding | Reads from rtl_fm stdout |
| rtl_433 | 433MHz sensors | JSON output parsing |
| dump1090 | ADS-B decoding | SBS protocol socket (port 30003) |
| acarsdec | ACARS messages | Output parsing |
| airmon-ng/airodump-ng | WiFi scanning | Monitor mode, CSV parsing |
| bluetoothctl/hcitool | Bluetooth | Fallback when DBus unavailable |
| slowrx | SSTV decoding | Subprocess with audio pipe |
| SatDump | Weather satellites | CLI live mode, NOAA APT + Meteor LRPT |
| AIS-catcher | AIS vessel tracking | JSON output parsing |
| direwolf | APRS | TNC modem for packet radio |

### Frontend Structure
- **Templates**: `templates/index.html` (main SPA), `templates/partials/modes/*.html` (sidebar panels), `templates/partials/nav.html` (global nav)
- **JS Modules**: `static/js/modes/*.js` - IIFE pattern per mode (e.g., `WeatherSat`, `SSTV`, `Meshtastic`)
- **CSS**: `static/css/modes/*.css` - scoped styles per mode, CSS variables for theming (`--bg-card`, `--accent-cyan`, `--font-mono`)
- **Mode Integration**: Each mode needs entries in `index.html` at ~12 points: CSS include, welcome card, partial include, visuals container, JS include, `validModes` set, `modeGroups` map, classList toggle, `modeNames`, visuals display toggle, titles, and init call in `switchMode()`

### Docker
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build: a Python 3.11 builder compiles SDR tools from source; the runtime copies their binaries/libraries (dump1090, AIS-catcher, slowrx, SatDump, etc.). CMD runs `start.sh` (gunicorn + gevent)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Two profiles: `basic` (standalone) and `history` (with Postgres for ADS-B)
- `build-multiarch.sh` - Multi-arch build script for amd64 + arm64 (RPi5)
- Data persisted via `./data:/app/data` volume mount

### Configuration
- `config.py` - Environment variable support with `INTERCEPT_` prefix (e.g., `INTERCEPT_PORT`, `INTERCEPT_WEATHER_SAT_GAIN`)
- Database: SQLite in `instance/` directory for settings, baselines, history

## Testing Notes

Tests use pytest with extensive mocking of external tools. Key fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`. Mock subprocess calls when testing decoder integration.


## Backlog: fix during the next major Intercept work

New minor items go in the shared backlog, `../ami/docs/backlog.md`, not here; the items below stay until done.

Owner-reported look-and-feel mismatches with AMI (2026-10-24). Not urgent; fold into the next substantial change. Fix them in the AMI visual layer (`static/css/ami-theme.css`, loaded by `partials/ami_head.html`) wherever possible, rather than per page.

- **Native checkboxes everywhere.** First noticed in ADS-B's DISPLAY group (`templates/adsb_dashboard.html` ~line 330: Trails, Rings, Labels, Reach), but every checkbox is the browser's own (only tinted by `accent-color`): about 90 in templates (index 13, adsb_dashboard 12, satellite_dashboard 7, settings-modal 7, modes/tscm 7, pager 6, waterfall 5, morse 5, ais_dashboard 5, wefax 3, and others) plus ones created in JS (`satellite-gps-drone.js`, `core/updater.js`, `tscm.js`, `spy-stations.js`). Give them one square outlined style matching AMI (`appearance:none`, border like AMI's outlined controls, accent tick, focus-visible ring), keeping them real inputs (keyboard and screen readers). Check the hand-styled ones aren't broken: `settings.css` ~286 (already `appearance:none`), `adsb_dashboard.css` 1298/1304, `.bias-t-label` (orange on purpose: it powers the antenna).
- **Alert counter is a red dot.** `.nav-notices-count` (`static/css/core/layout.css` ~1408; markup `partials/nav.html` `#navNoticesCount`) is a red rounded pill with white text. AMI's bell counter is a square amber badge with dark text (`ami/public/css/ami.css` `.bell-n`: `background:var(--warn)`, `color:#1a1000`). Match it. Leave red where it means danger (`.dsc-distress-alert`, `.squawk-alert-banner`, `.badge-danger`, error status dots).
- **Explanations (tooltips).** There's a lot on screen and most of it is unexplained to a newcomer. Today there are ~195 plain `title=` attributes (the browser's delayed, unstyled tooltip, none on touch) and a CSS-only `[data-tooltip]` (`static/css/core/components.css` ~627) used 6 times. Wanted: explanations of what each mode, control, reading and term means and why it matters, in the style of VIGIL's signal tooltips (`VIGIL/dashboard/public/js/tooltips.js`, `signalGuideItems` in core.js: what it means / why it matters / what it doesn't mean; whole rows as targets; hover delay set in Settings; tap-to-explain on touch). Build the tooltip engine once in `ami/shared/ui/` (ADR 0014) so VIGIL and Intercept share it, keep the explanation texts in Intercept, and inside AMI keep them readable aloud like the rest.
- **Satellite dashboard error:** `templates/satellite_dashboard.html` (~line 1881) uses `_gsEventSource`, which is never declared, so the page throws `ReferenceError: _gsEventSource is not defined` (seen in a headless run, 2026-10-24; predates the AMI work). Declare it with the other ground-station state.
- After any of these: run the browser smoke tests in light and dark, desktop and phone, embedded (`?ami=1`) and standalone.

## AMI integration (fork-owned)

- Read `../ami/docs/handoffs/README.md` (the sibling AMI checkout) and open notes before editing when that sibling checkout is available. Never commit another task's changes.
- `routes/ami.py` and `utils/ami.py` implement the opt-in, admin-only read-only service module. `AMI_URL` must be an HTTP(S) origin; `INTERCEPT_AMI_TOKEN_SHA256` contains the service token's SHA-256 digest. Browser sessions never authorize MCP or events.
- Receiver reads use the existing discovery cache; never probe or start a decoder from an AMI read tool. Tool data is explicitly allowlisted. No pager payloads, WiFi/Bluetooth identities, observer coordinates, serial numbers or network receiver addresses enter AMI read tools.
- `instance/ami-events.sqlite` persists decoder-health transitions for 48 hours. Existing stopped processes generate a critical event after 60 seconds; idle modes do not. One WSGI worker owns Intercept's global decoder state. SSE supports `Last-Event-ID`.
- `static/css/ami-theme.css` is a new fork-owned visual layer, loaded once by every document head. Preserve semantic spectrum/map colours and local/offline assets. Embed via `?ami=1`; allow framing only from the configured AMI origin and self. The UI still requires Intercept's own login.
- See `docs/AMI.md` for setup, tests and deployment. No version bumps or live deployment without the owner's authorization; hardware mappings must be explicit. Never add agent attribution to commits.

- Static asset URLs append `-ami1` to the upstream version as a cache key; the displayed release version is unchanged. Change the asset revision when future fork changes would otherwise reuse cached scripts.

- Embedded speech uses `window.InterceptAMI` in ami-bridge.js and AMI’s `ami-speak`/`ami-speech` messages. VoiceAlerts keeps its queue/mute/source choices; automatic speech also requires AMI autoplay. Never synthesize locally inside AMI or expose separate voice/rate/pitch choices there. Standalone speech remains native.

## Account preferences (fork-owned)

- `utils/preferences.py` is the complete localStorage classification and server allowlist; the first head script receives that same registry. Add every new key there, including any dynamic prefix, and choose its scope deliberately. `tests/test_preferences.py` checks literal keys and the layout list.
- SYNCED: observer/module locations, theme/map theme, timezone/hour format, UI tier, default mode/setup/disclaimer, update choice, `intercept_settings`, watch/ignore/mute lists, pager/OOK/waterfall presets, bias-T, Morse/station/receiver preferences and ADS-B range/retention/history choices. There is currently no separate AIS watch-list localStorage key.
- PER-DEVICE: all `LAYOUT_KEYS`/`LAYOUT_PREFIXES`, other view/overlay/autoscroll choices, speaker audio/mute/voice config, debug flags, transient handoff/session/dismissal data, legacy animation keys, `intercept.reach.*` reception caches and the sync owner marker/outbox (`intercept.prefs.pending.<user id>`). Generic storage helpers have no callers; module location keys are explicitly enumerated.
- Account prefs use the session username resolved to `users.id`, never identity headers. NULL rows are deletion markers; first imports cannot overwrite existing rows. Shared HTML heads hydrate before other scripts read storage; global observer-location `.env` persistence remains separate.

## AMI entry and away access (fork-owned)

- `INTERCEPT_AMI_ONLY_AWAY=1` enforces AMI entry for `X-Intercept-Access: away` only with positive `INTERCEPT_TRUSTED_PROXIES`. Caddy must overwrite home/away on every public request; headerless internal health/module calls retain existing behaviour. Never expose the container directly.
- Bearer-only `POST /api/module/session` requires MFA true and `INTERCEPT_AMI_USERS` mapping to an enabled local account; `/ami/enter` consumes a hashed, single-use 60-second pass and replaces the normal session with `via_ami=True`. Local account roles and forced password changes remain authoritative. Keep one worker and never log entry tickets.
